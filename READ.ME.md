Horiseon project
The goal of this project was to take Horiseons already existing page and make it more accesible.
 along with making it more accessible the goal was to make sure the HTML and CSS elements followed logical structure.
 I also was to make sure that structures where independent from each other while making sure to add alts to discribe
  images and also make sure the CSS code was as effeicent as possible.
